# MNIST_dataset
##Description
This is my second competition on Kaggle. It's digit recognition model with 90.95% accuracy.
I used Dense layers of neural network with L2 regularization to prevent overfit.
The model is still neccessary to be approved.
Hyperparamters that need to be tuned.
- neural network layers
- number of neurons
- Epoch size
- Lambda value
- Learning rate
- Different activation function
